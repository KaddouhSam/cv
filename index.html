  <table cellspacing="10">
    <!-- it is a better way to write the table like this, with the header, body, and foot
    and treat it like an HTML element for later easier functionality in the code.
    However we can write a table without using body, head or foot because <th is a table header element and the browser understands that this should be bold and on the top.
  we can add a border attribute to the table but it wouldnt like nice because CSS offers better design code.-->
